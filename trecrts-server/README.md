# TREC RTS Evaluation Broker REST(ful) API

## Client Endpoints

### POST /register/system

- Request body should be a JSON object as follows: `{"groupid":"trec group identifier","alias":"system alias"}`
- The `groupid` will be provided by the organizers.
- The `alias` is a human-friendly identifier that you specify to help identify the client, e.g., `WaterlooBaseline`. We will use this alias as the "runid" to report results (e.g., in the track overview paper), so usual TREC rules apply (e.g., no spaces).

Use this API endpoint to register a client with the evaluation broker.
The API call will return a JSON object of the client id to be used by the system when making requests, e.g., `{"clientid":"abcdefghijk"}`.

Note that each call to this API endpoint will return a unique client id. Therefore, for each individual experimental run, you should request a separate client id.

You can manually test this API with `curl` as follows:

```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"groupid":"mygroup","alias":"MyBaseline"}' hostname.com/register/system
```

### GET /topics/:clientid

- **:clientid** is the client id that was returned by the broker above. This is used for bookkeeping/rate-limiting purposes.

Use this API endpoint to request the "interest profiles" (also called "topics") to be evaluated.
An interest profile is a JSON-formatted structure that contains the
same information as a "traditional" *ad hoc* topic:

```
  { "id" : "MB246",
    "title" : "Greek international debt crisis",
    "description" : "Find information related to the crisis surrounding the Greek debt to international creditors, and the consequences of their possible withdrawal from the European Union.",
    "narrative" : "Given the continuing crisis over the Greek debt to international creditors, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Central Bank (ECB), and the European Commission, the user is interested in information on how this debt is being handled, including the possible withdrawal of Greece from the euro zone, and the consequences of such a move."
  }
```

The "title" contains a short description of the information need,
similar to what users would type into a search engine. The
"description" and "narrative" are sentence- and paragraph-long
elaborations of the information need, respectively.
The API will return a list of these JSON structures.

Please do not poll the API for topics more than once every hour.

You can manually test this API with `curl` as follows:

```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' hostname.com/topics/abcdefghijk
```

### POST /tweet/:topid/:tweetid/:clientid

- **:topid** specifies the topic identifier.
- **:tweetid** specifies the id of the tweet from the Twitter Streaming API that was identified as being relevant to the topic.
- **:clientid** is the client's identifier that was returned when the system was registered. This is used for bookkeeping/rate-limiting purposes.

Use this API endpoint to submit a tweet for assessment with respect to a particular topic. Returns a 204 status code on success.

You can manually test this API with `curl` as follows:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' hostname.com/tweet/MBXXX/738418531520352258/abcdefghijk
```

### POST /assessments/:topid/:clientid

- **:topid** specifies the topic identifier.
- **:clientid** is the client's identifier that was returned when the system was registered. This is used for bookkeeping/rate-limiting purposes.

Use this API endpoint to get back live assessments for the tweets posted for this topic.

You can manually test this API with `curl` as follows:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' hostname.com/assessments/MBXXX/abcdefghijk
```

    + used for pushing tweets to the device

### POST /tweet/:topid/:tweetid/:rel/:partid
  - **:topid** specifies the topic identifier
  - **:tweetid** specifies the tweet identifier supplied by the Twitter Streaming API 
  - **:rel** is the relevance assessment (-1 or 1) of tweet to the topic
